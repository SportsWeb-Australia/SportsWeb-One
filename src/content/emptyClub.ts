import type { ClubConfig } from "./types";

/**
 * Neutral, content-free club config -- "a club with nothing filled in yet".
 *
 * Every NON-demo club is built from this base in loadClub.ts, so none of the demo
 * club's (Dookie's) content can leak in. Only genuinely structural / non-club-specific
 * defaults are present: generic nav + quick links (pointing at the real routes),
 * generic hero/CTA labels, section toggles, and an empty placeholder match centre.
 * Every club-identifying field (name, contact, hero copy, president, about,
 * acknowledgement, sponsors/news/events/teams, logo, colours) is blank/empty and is
 * filled from the club's own clubs row + club_content. The demo club keeps using
 * club.config.ts (staticClub).
 *
 * Authored as an explicit literal (no staticClub spread) on purpose: if ClubConfig
 * gains a field, the build fails here loudly instead of silently inheriting Dookie's.
